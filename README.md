# stack_movies
A comprehensive full-stack movie management system built with React.js for the frontend, Node.js and Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB as the database. This application allows users to browse and view detailed information about movies categorized by theaters, and make reservations. It features a robust user authentication system with role-based access control, enabling regular users to book tickets while providing admin functionalities such as adding, updating, and deleting movies. The system offers dynamic content display, ensuring that movie listings, showtimes, and reservations are updated in real time based on the data in the database. The interface is designed to be responsive, offering seamless usability across different devices. Additionally, JWT-based authentication ensures secure user sessions, while the admin dashboard gives administrators full control over managing movie records and user reservations. This platform is ideal for cinemas or theater chains looking for a modern, scalable solution for managing their movie schedules and customer bookings.
